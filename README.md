# CS50

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard's CS50.  
Each folder represents a weekly problem set aligned with the course topics.

## Problem Sets

- [**pset0 – Scratch**](./pset0/)  
  Introduction to programming using Scratch (block-based logic).

- [**pset1 – C Basics**](./pset1/)  
  Learn the basics of C: compilation, functions, conditionals, and loops.

- [**pset2 – Arrays**](./pset2/)  
  Implement classic ciphers like Caesar and Substitution using arrays.

- [**pset3 – Algorithms**](./pset3/)  
  Implement searching and sorting algorithms (e.g., binary search, bubble sort).

- [**pset4 – Memory**](./pset4/)  
  Explore pointers, memory allocation, and file I/O through filter and recover.

- [**pset5 – Data Structures**](./pset5/)  
  Implement a spell-checker using hash tables and linked lists.

- [**pset6 – Python Basics**](./pset6/)  
  Transition from C to Python; rewrite previous problems in Python.
